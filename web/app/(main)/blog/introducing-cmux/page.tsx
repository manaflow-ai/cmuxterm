      <h1>Introducing cmux</h1>
      <time className="text-sm text-muted">February 12, 2026</time>

      <p className="mt-6">
        cmux is a native macOS terminal application built on top of Ghostty,
        designed from the ground up for developers who run multiple AI coding
        agents simultaneously.
      </p>

      <h2>Why cmux?</h2>
      <p>
        Modern development workflows often involve running several agents at
        once &mdash; Claude Code, Codex, and other tools each in their own
        terminal. Keeping track of which ones need attention and switching
        between them quickly is the problem cmux solves.
      </p>

      <h2>Key features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vertical tabs</strong> &mdash; see all your terminals at a
          glance in a sidebar
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notification rings</strong> &mdash; tabs flash when an agent
          needs your input
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Split panes</strong> &mdash; horizontal and vertical splits
          within each workspace
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Socket API</strong> &mdash; programmatic control for creating
          tabs and sending input
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GPU-accelerated</strong> &mdash; powered by libghostty for
          smooth rendering
        </li>
      </ul>
