# Checks the things cmux believes about `et`, against `et`.
#
# The ET transport shipped with six defects that shared one cause: its load-bearing claims about
# EternalTerminal lived in a design doc and in comments, and nothing executed them. Unit tests
# could not catch any of them — they assert what cmux builds, which is the model, not what the
# other program does. 77 of them passed while the transport could not carry a stream at all.
#
# So each claim gets one check here. A claim that cannot be written as a check is an assumption,
# and belongs in the PR as one.
#
# Version matters more than usual. ET is not as widely deployed as tmux, and its behaviour does
# move between series: 7.x rewrote the pty input path that 6.x deadlocks on. Run this against
# every version you intend to support and treat a divergence as a finding.
#
# Measured so far (all five checks pass, identically):
#   et 6.2.11+7  — the version installed on the machine this was developed against
#   et 7.0.0     — built from source at tag et-v7.0.0
#
# The interesting non-difference: 7.x rewrote the pty input path specifically because 6.x
# deadlocks on a large input burst, yet a >MAX_CANON command is still not delivered on either.
# The limit is a property of the tty line discipline, not of how the server writes to it, so the
# bound cmux relies on survives that rewrite. That was worth measuring rather than assuming in
# either direction — the prediction going in was that 7.x would deliver it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/remote-tmux-et-conformance.sh                      # the et on PATH
#   ET_CLIENT=/path/to/et ET_SERVER=/path/to/etserver \
#     ET_TERMINAL=/path/to/etterminal scripts/remote-tmux-et-conformance.sh
#
# The client connects to CMUX_ET_HOST (default `127.0.0.1`), which must be an ssh
# destination this machine can log into, because et bootstraps over ssh before its own
# protocol takes over. The loopback default works wherever this machine runs sshd and
# accepts key auth for the current user; point CMUX_ET_HOST at a different destination
# (an ssh_config alias, another host) when that is not the case.
#
# Exit code is the number of failed checks (0 = every belief holds).
