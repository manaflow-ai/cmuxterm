# Fails if remote-tmux gains a new sleep, timer, or poll loop.
#
# Remote-tmux waits on things constantly — a control-mode reply, a shared master, a person
# finishing a login — and every one of those has an event to wait on. A timer instead of the
# event is not a style preference: its interval is dead time a frozen mirror spends after the
# thing it was waiting for already happened, and it can miss the event entirely.
#
# This exists because knowing that is not enough. A reviewer caught a `Task.sleep` backoff in
# the login waiter that had shipped with a comment claiming "there is no event to subscribe
# to" — the event was the ControlMaster socket being created, and `FileWatcher` had been in
# the tree the whole time. Nothing failed when that went in, so nothing will fail the next
# time either, unless something checks.
#
# Adding a wait that genuinely has no edge is allowed, but it has to be listed below with the
# reason, which makes the exception visible in review instead of implicit in a diff.
#
# Usage: scripts/lint-remote-tmux-no-polling.sh
# Exit 0 when clean, 1 with the offending file:line otherwise.

Waiting on a timer means the event that ends the wait was not used. Find the edge first:
  - a control-mode reply            -> sendTracked / the %begin/%end correlation
  - a file or socket appearing      -> FileWatcher (watches the parent directory too, so
                                       creation is visible for a path that does not exist yet)
  - terminal output, e.g. a marker  -> the per-surface PTY tee detectors
  - a workspace closing             -> the TabManager close path calls the controller
An event-driven wait must also check its condition once up front: an edge that already
happened is never delivered.

If there is genuinely no edge, add the symbol to ALLOW in this script with the reason.
