"""Print the cmux crash reports a run produced, and keep a copy of them.

macOS writes crash reports to one fixed per-user directory and gives no way to redirect it, so
a run cannot have its own. What a run can have is a snapshot taken before it starts: anything
cmux-named that appears afterwards belongs to it. That is a set difference, which beats
comparing timestamps — it survives a clock that jumped, a report written in another timezone,
and macOS rewriting mtimes when it prunes. Copying the matches into a per-run directory is what
makes the evidence outlive both the pruner and the job.

The test runner's "Restarting after unexpected exit, crash, or test timeout" line is the
event to grade a run on, because it is the runner noticing a host it has to replace. It
misses a crash with nothing left to restart — one during teardown, after the last verdict
has already printed. That crash is still an over-release, and without this the shard reads
clean.

A count of zero still is not proof that nothing crashed: ReportCrash writes the file
asynchronously, so a report can land after the scan. This backs the restart check up rather
than replacing it.

Usage:
  scripts/crash-reports-since.py --snapshot FILE               # before the run
  scripts/crash-reports-since.py --new-since FILE [--copy-to DIR]
  scripts/crash-reports-since.py '2026-07-23 17:40:00'         # timestamp fallback
  scripts/crash-reports-since.py --self-test

Prints one filename per line. Exit 0 whether or not anything is found; the caller decides what
a hit means. Exits non-zero only when the scan itself could not run, so a caller must not
swallow the status.
