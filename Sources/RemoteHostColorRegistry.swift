/// Assigns each remote destination a color from the workspace color palette so
/// servers are easy to tell apart at a glance, and the same destination shows the
/// same color in every open window for the life of the app session. Gated by the
/// `remoteTmux.originColors.beta` flag at the call sites.
///
/// Keyed by the host's `destination` STRING (the ssh alias or `user@host` — the
/// "host name" the user typed), NOT the port/identity-specific ``connectionHash``.
/// That deliberately keeps one color per destination string across ports, at the
/// cost that two spellings of the same box (`box` vs `user@box`) are treated as
/// two hosts. This is a recognizability hint, not an identity — collisions are
/// expected once there are more hosts than palette colors.
///
/// Assignment rule ("hash the host name to a color; on a collision take the next
/// color"):
/// 1. `destination` is hashed with a STABLE FNV-1a string hash (not Swift's
///    per-process randomized `Hasher`) to a starting palette index — so a host
///    that never collides lands on the same color across app launches too.
/// 2. Linear-probe forward from that start to the first slot not already held by a
///    different host — the "collision → next color" behavior.
/// 3. If every slot is taken (more hosts than palette colors), fall back to the
///    hashed start and let colors repeat.
/// 4. The chosen slot is cached per destination, so repeat lookups from any window
///    return the same color.
///
/// Consistency guarantee: within one running session the cache gives a destination
/// one color in every window. Across restarts a lone host is stable (step 1), but
/// two hosts that collide on the same start can swap colors depending on which was
/// seen first. Assignments are in-memory and the cache never shrinks (stale hosts
/// keep reserving a slot); durable persistence and eviction are deliberate
/// follow-ups.
/// One instance is owned by ``RemoteTmuxController`` (itself owned by `AppDelegate`
/// at the app seam) and reached through it, so assignments stay consistent
/// process-wide without an ambient global. Tests construct their own instance with
/// an injected `slotCount` to exercise the probing deterministically.
