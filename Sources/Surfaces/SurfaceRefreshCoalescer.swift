/// passes (one that started before the burst ended, one that sees everything after),
/// a session that never goes quiet is re-read after every pass instead of being starved
/// by a restarted delay, and no signal is ever coordinated through `Task.sleep`.

/// Main-actor bound like its callers (a provider is main-actor state); `perform` is the
/// pass itself and may take as long as a network round trip.
