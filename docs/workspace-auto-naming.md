# Workspace auto-naming

Opt-in AI naming of sidebar workspaces and tabs from agent conversation content. With several concurrent agent sessions, the sidebar otherwise shows identical rows ("Claude Code", "codex"); auto-naming turns them into short, topic-bearing names that refresh as each conversation moves.

Off by default. Enable it in **Settings > Automation > Workspace Auto-Naming** or via `automation.workspaceAutoNaming` in `cmux.json` (see [configuration.md](configuration.md#automationworkspaceautonaming)).

## What it does

- At the end of an agent turn, cmux summarizes the session's recent conversation into a 2-5 word title (in the conversation's language) and applies it to the workspace. When a workspace has multiple tabs, the agent's own tab is named too.
- Names refresh when the topic shifts, throttled by transcript growth and a minimum interval, so quiet or single-topic sessions converge to a stable name without repeated summarization calls.
- Summarization runs through your own agent binary: `claude -p` for Claude Code sessions (model from `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` when set, the fast default otherwise; Vertex/Bedrock backend selection is preserved), `codex exec` for Codex sessions, and each supported hook agent's own non-interactive CLI for its sessions. Each agent names itself, so the calls use the account you already authenticated, and a machine without another agent installed simply skips that adapter.

## Precedence: manual names always win

Custom titles carry a provenance marker (user vs auto):

- A name you set yourself - sidebar rename, command palette, `cmux rename-workspace`/`rename-tab`, or Claude's `/rename` - is never overwritten by auto-naming, and auto-naming for that workspace or tab stops.
- Custom titles that predate this feature (snapshots persisted before provenance existed) restore as user-set: existing named workspaces are never auto-renamed. Workspaces without a custom title (the common "Claude Code"-row case) auto-name normally.
- Clearing your custom name re-opens the workspace or tab to auto-naming (sidebar, command palette, or `cmux workspace-action --action clear-name`).
- Auto names lose to the user everywhere else too: OSC terminal titles never override any custom title (unchanged behavior), and provenance survives session restore and moving tabs between workspaces.

## Guarantees

- No summarization call ever runs unless the setting is on; the hooks gate themselves on the live setting, so toggling takes effect on the next turn without restarting agents.
- Only the workspace's current agent session names it: stale, background, and nested (subagent) sessions are filtered by the same active-session gates the notification hooks use.
- Failures degrade silently to current behavior - no binary on PATH, a timed-out call, or an unsupported backend just means the name does not change.
- Naming never blocks the agent: the Claude pass runs as an async hook and the generic hook adapters run detached from the hook process.

## Supported adapters

Auto-naming currently has source adapters and summarizer runners for:

- Claude Code: reads the Claude transcript JSONL and summarizes with `claude -p`.
- Codex: reads the Codex rollout JSONL and summarizes with `codex exec --output-last-message`.
- Grok: reads Grok's `chat_history.jsonl` for the active session and summarizes with `grok --prompt-file` with tools and web search disabled.
- OpenCode: caches recent prompt/assistant text from the cmux OpenCode session plugin and summarizes with `opencode run --pure` from an isolated temporary directory.
- Pi and OMP: cache prompt/assistant text from their cmux hooks and summarize with their own non-interactive CLIs (`pi --print --no-tools` and `omp --print --no-tools`).

The other hook integrations are intentionally skipped for now:

- Amp's current cmux plugin reports lifecycle/status but does not expose a usable prompt or assistant transcript.
- Gemini has hook payload text, but the available non-interactive CLI invocation has not been verified to disable tools/project access, so it is skipped rather than running untrusted transcript text through a tool-capable summarizer.
- Cursor, Antigravity, Kiro, Rovo Dev, Hermes Agent, Copilot, CodeBuddy, Factory, and Qoder have cmux Stop/notification hooks, but this branch does not yet have both a verified transcript source and a safe cheap non-interactive summarizer invocation that disables tools/project access.

## Codex's native tab title (independent of this feature)

Separately from opt-in auto-naming above, cmux mirrors Codex's own natively-generated thread title (`~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`, `threads.title`, read via the `CodexNativeTitleStore` helper in the `CMUXAgentLaunch` package) onto the panel's raw terminal tab title at every turn end — the same precedence tier OSC terminal-title updates already write to, and any existing custom title (auto or user) is left untouched exactly as it already is for OSC. The detached Codex Stop-hook process resolves the title itself and sends the app the plain string, so the app-side socket handler does no database or file I/O. This runs unconditionally, is not gated by the `automation.workspaceAutoNaming` setting, and never calls a summarizer, because Codex already computed the title itself. It exists because Codex's CLI does not emit OSC title updates tracking its live conversation title the way Claude Code's CLI does, so without this a Codex tab's title would silently lag Claude's (cmux #11144).

## Mechanics

The Claude Code wrapper registers an async `Stop` hook (`cmux hooks claude auto-name`); other supported agents spawn an equivalent detached pass from their turn-end hook. Each pass reads the adapter's transcript source, evaluates the throttle against per-session state in `~/.cmuxterm/<agent>-hook-sessions.json`, and applies the title through the `workspace.set_auto_title` socket method, which enforces the setting and the user-provenance rule app-side.
