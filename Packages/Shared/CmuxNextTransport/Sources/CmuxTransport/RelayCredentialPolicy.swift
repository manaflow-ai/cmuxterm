/// `.tokenMinting` is today's deployed contract (cmux-relay#8): every relay
/// connection presents an endpoint-bound JWT, the relay closes the socket at
/// the token's `exp`, and the client must re-mint before that deadline.
///
/// `.registryAllow` is the intended shape (cmux-relay#9 + web #10730): the
/// relay proves the endpoint key in its handshake and asks the broker's
/// allow hook whether that key is in the account registry. The client holds
/// no credential, mints nothing, and runs no renewal loop; revocation is a
/// registry flip plus a relay-side kick. Select it only once the fleet runs
/// the allow hook (dual-accept keeps `.tokenMinting` clients working during
/// the migration window).
