# CmuxTerminalCore

The terminal domain's core leaf: pure and Sendable terminal logic with no view dependency, lifted out of the app target's `GhosttyTerminalView.swift`. Higher terminal packages (engine, surface model, surface views) and the app depend on this; it depends only on GhosttyKit, `CmuxTerminalCopyMode`, and the DEBUG-only event log.

## Layout

- `Interop/` — `GhosttyRuntimeCInterop`, the one sanctioned seam for `@_silgen_name` libghostty bindings.
- `KeyEvents/` — `ghostty_input_action_e.modifierActionForFlagsChanged` (flagsChanged press/release resolution) and the `NSEvent.ModifierFlags` adapter for `CmuxTerminalCopyMode`.
- `PathResolution/` — `TerminalPathResolver`, the path heuristics behind cmd-click QuickLook and terminal file-link opening.
- `LinkRouting/` — `TerminalLinkRouter` and `TerminalOpenURLTarget`, routing terminal links to the embedded browser or the system through the `BrowserHostNormalizing` seam.
- `Focus/` — `TerminalPointerFocusActivationPolicy`, the pure ownership decision that keeps captured Ghostty mouse sequences intact across pane focus changes.
- `SurfaceCallbacks/` — `GhosttySurfaceCallbackContext`, the retained userdata for libghostty callbacks, behind the `TerminalSurfaceControlling`/`TerminalSurfaceHosting` seams.
- `SurfaceValues/` — the Sendable surface value DTOs (`PendingKeyEvent`, `PendingSocketInput`, `ParsedSocketInput`, `NamedKeySendResult`, `InputSendResult`, `PortalLifecycleState`, `PortalHostLease`).
- `TitleChurn/` — `TerminalTitleChurnFilter`, the value normalizer that collapses known standalone Braille spinner tokens before ingress deduplication.
- `TitlePresentation/` — `CodexTabTitleComposer`, the injected value policy that maps Codex lifecycle state to a transient tab marker without changing the stable title.
- `Scrollbar/` — `GhosttyScrollbar`, the runtime scrollback geometry snapshot.
- `DebugSupport/` — DEBUG-only UI-test scaffolding (`TerminalChildExitProbe`, scalar-hex journaling).

## Seams

Protocols are owned here and implemented in the app target: `BrowserHostNormalizing` (browser-domain host validation for link routing) and `TerminalSurfaceControlling`/`TerminalSurfaceHosting` (the surface model and host view sides of the runtime callback context). The app injects conformances at the composition root; this package never imports the app or the browser domain.

## Testing

All logic is pure or probe-injectable, so tests run headlessly with `swift test`. The path resolver takes a `fileExists` closure, the link router takes a stub `BrowserHostNormalizing`, and the callback context takes plain test doubles of its two seams. Stateless values can be constructed directly in tests:

```swift
let filter = TerminalTitleChurnFilter()
#expect(filter.stableTitle(for: "⠋ Building") == "Building")

let composer = CodexTabTitleComposer()
#expect(composer.presentation(
    baseTitle: "Build",
    lifecycle: .running,
    hasUserOwnedTitle: false
).title == "◐ Build")
```

The running (`◐`) and idle (`✳`) prefixes are non-linguistic status glyphs.
They intentionally use the same shape in every locale, so they are kept as
package presentation tokens rather than duplicated marker-only localization
entries. Hosts may inject another visual vocabulary through
`CodexTabTitleComposer(runningMarker:idleMarker:)` when their tab design calls
for it.
