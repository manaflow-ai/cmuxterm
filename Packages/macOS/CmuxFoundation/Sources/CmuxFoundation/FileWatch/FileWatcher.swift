/// config file, a settings file, a directory listing — where recursive subtree
/// watching is not needed.
///
/// **Recovery.** Alongside the path itself the watcher observes the *nearest
/// existing ancestor directory*, so its stream recovers when the path is created,
/// replaced, atomically saved, or when an intervening directory is created or
/// removed after the watcher starts (the path frequently does not exist on first
/// use). As ancestors appear the directory source migrates closer to the path,
/// and the path-level source reattaches to the current inode.
///
/// An optional leading-edge ``throttle`` coalesces a burst of events into a
/// single yield, driven through the injectable ``FileWatchClock`` (see
/// ``RecursivePathWatcher`` for the rationale and the deterministic test
/// pattern). Both internal and public streams retain only the newest undelivered
/// signal because events are invalidations rather than quantities. With no
