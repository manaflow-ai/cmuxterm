/// Behavioral UI tests for the Settings sections that make up the
/// "Account + cmux.json + Reset" group: the Account identity row, the
/// cmux.json config-file/docs card, and the Reset All Settings button.
///
/// These three sidebar sections (`Account`, `cmux.json`, `Reset`) are
/// almost entirely *action* rows: their controls fire a host action
/// (open a file in an external editor, launch a browser auth flow, open
/// a docs URL) rather than persist a defaults-backed value. The only
/// control whose effect is observable purely inside the cmux app surface
/// is **Reset All Settings**, which clears every catalog key — provable
/// by flipping a defaults-backed Settings toggle, resetting, and watching
/// the toggle snap back to its default.
///
/// Tier classification (see the structured output and the TIER comments
/// throughout this file):
/// - TIER 1: Reset All Settings (effect verified by a reverted toggle).
/// - TIER 2: cmux.json "Open" button (opens the config file in an
///   external editor — leaves the cmux process, no in-app element).
/// - TIER 3: Account Sign In / Sign Out (browser auth round trip),
///   cmux.json "Open Docs" link (external browser).
///
/// The Account identity row and the cmux.json card *layout* are still
/// asserted for presence, because those elements are real accessibility
/// elements in the main app surface (the identity row's signed-out title
/// + button; the `SettingsJSONOpenButton` / `SettingsJSONDocsLink` ids).
/// Presence is a weaker claim than an effect, so those are not counted as
/// TIER-1 behavioral coverage — they only guard against the section
/// failing to render at all.

    //   the host as `NSWorkspace.shared.open(configFileURL)`. This launches the
    //   user's default editor for ~/.config/cmux/cmux.json in a *separate*
    //   application. cmux opens no in-app window and changes no in-app element,
    //   so XCUITest (scoped to the cmux process) cannot observe the effect.
    //   Verifying it would require a runtime seam (e.g. a host action spy /
    //   injectable opener that records the opened URL); per task constraints we
    //   do not add app seams. Asserted for presence only above.

    // TIER 3 (not e2e): Account "Sign In…" / "Sign Out" button (AccountIdentityCard)
    //   — `startSignIn()` routes to HostBrowserSignInFlow.beginSignIn(), which opens the
    //   cmux sign-in page in the system browser for an OAuth-style round trip;
    //   `signOut()` performs a backend network call. Neither produces an in-app
    //   window or element XCUITest can drive without real credentials and an
    //   external browser. The signed-out identity *display* state is asserted
    //   for presence above; the click effect is out of scope for e2e.

    // TIER 3 (not e2e): cmux.json "Open Docs" link (SettingsJSONDocsLink)
    //   — a SwiftUI `Link` to https://cmux.com/docs/configuration#cmux-json that
    //   opens in the system browser. Cross-app navigation with no cmux-side
    //   observable effect. Presence asserted above; the navigation itself is
    //   out of scope for e2e.
